<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm  Vishwas Kashyap! I'm currently in my final semester of a B.Tech in Information Technology at Manipal Institute of Technology, Bengaluru. Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to explore a wide range of technologies, and I'm particularly passionate about software development.
I also pursued a minor specialization in Computational Intelligence, which has allowed me to dive deep into algorithms, machine learning, and intelligent systems.</p>
<p> My technical toolkit includes proficiency in Java, C, C++, Python, and MERN stack development, enabling me to approach software problems from multiple angles and build efficient, scalable solutions.</p>
<p>
Outside of tech, I have a deep love for cricket and enjoy unwinding with some great music. Whether it's a weekend cricket match or listening to my favorite tunes, I believe in balancing work with passion.
I'm looking forward to contributing my skills to real-world projects, and I am especially excited about opportunities in software development where I can continue to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact.</p>

<p>Feel free to connect if you'd like to chat about tech, cricket, or anything in between!</p>
